    "\n",
    "Docker uses the same OS kernel as its host. Thus, it's much more lightweight. It uses layered filesystem (AuFS) that was not a standard in case of VMs. Similarly to VMs, Docker creates a local network for communication with host.\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes. Thanks to AuFS we will need only one copy of the base layers. Ubuntu container requires 188MB diskspace to run. So, we can do it even on a machine with only 200MB. Note that in case of VMs we would have to create 1000 copies of the filesystem and would not fit within 100GB."

    "Imagine we're back to 2012. People use software like Ansible, Chef, Pupper, Vagrant, etc. There was no notion of containers or layers, and deployment was based on mundane configuration of virtual machines. While it was not a problem in case of small infrastructures, in case of large systems it took most of the operations team time.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was the primary reason Docker why was developed. Nowadays people see additional usecases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- simplifying configuration of development projects\n",
    "- managing pipelines in development process (dev -> test deployment -> production deployment)\n",
    "- possibility of running an environment very similar to the production system on a laptop\n",
    "- app isolation (machine learning services too!)\n",
    "- writing multitenant applications\n",
    "- continuos deployment\n",

By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machineâ€™s network connection.\n",
